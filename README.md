üóëÔ∏è Automatic Indicating Dustbin

The Automatic Indicating Dustbin is an innovative project designed to promote hygiene and smart waste management through automation. The system uses ultrasonic sensors, a servo motor, and an Arduino microcontroller to automatically open the dustbin lid whenever a person‚Äôs hand is detected near it. This touchless operation reduces direct contact with waste, thereby minimizing the spread of germs and maintaining cleanliness in the surroundings.

In addition to automatic lid movement, the dustbin is equipped with a waste level indication system using three LEDs‚Äîgreen, yellow, and red‚Äîto show whether the dustbin is empty, half-filled, or full. One ultrasonic sensor is placed near the lid to detect approaching hands, while another sensor is placed inside the dustbin to measure the fill level. When the dustbin is full, the red LED glows continuously to alert the user that it needs to be emptied.

The system is powered by an Arduino Uno, which serves as the main control unit. The servo motor operates the lid mechanism, while the LEDs and sensors are connected to the Arduino‚Äôs digital pins for data input and output. The project is powered using a simple 5V DC supply, making it efficient and cost-effective. It uses basic components such as jumper wires, resistors, and a breadboard for circuit assembly, which makes it easy to build and suitable for both students and beginners in electronics.

This project has a wide range of practical applications in homes, offices, hospitals, shopping malls, and public places, where maintaining hygiene is of utmost importance. It can be further enhanced by integrating IoT technology to send real-time alerts when the bin is full, or by adding solar power to make it energy-efficient. Overall, the Automatic Indicating Dustbin is a smart, eco-friendly, and affordable solution that combines automation and cleanliness to create a healthier environment for everyone.
